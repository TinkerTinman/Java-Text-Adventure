# Java-Text-Adventure
Java project needed to get college credit

I needed to learn Java for college credit and felt the best thing I could do is write an interactive fiction game inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure written by Will Crowther and Zork that was developed by Infocom.  It's not fancy and the program doesn't respond with the quarter of the sass I'd like it too, but it works and I made it in such a way that I could add to it if I ever got bored.  Feel free to do what you like with it, once I understood the base 5 or 6 elements at play it really helped me learn fast.
